							<h2>Get to know me!</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am a first generation computer science student studying at CUNY Queens College. I love to learn new ways to implement solutions
							and optimize code. Funnily enough, I never worry about debugging code since everything I write is tested as I go along, leading
							to clean and working code the whole way through. As a personal hobby, I love to sew! I can tailor things but I'm not the best 
							at creating things from scratch yet. I also really love to read. I am not too picky about what I read but I really 
							love to read mysteries and thrillers. I find it really fun to try and put the pieces together before the narrarator does. Feel 
						    free to reach out reccomend some books! </p>

								<h3>Bronx Science Course Helper</h3>
								<p>The Bronx Science Course Helper was inspired by the annoyance I felt when having to go back in forth between pages of the school 
									course handbook and having to write down courses that I'm interested in. Not only that but we would also have to manually check 
									prerequistes to see if we are allowed to take the course. I built this app to allow students to automatically check prerequistes,
									save/bookmark classes they are interested in and even allow students to share ratings about the class itself</p>

								<h3>Ambulance Prediction</h3>
								<p>The Ambulance prediction website was something I worked on in a group that shows how Machine Learning can help
									ambulance identify the severity of the injury immedietly but also transport them to the nearest hospital that has
									the capacity to actually help them. Many times, ambulances might take the patient to the nearest hospital but at times
									the hospital capacity is full and they are unable to give the attention the patient needs. Using this application, they 
									can predict which hospital has the accomodations for them (and routes them based on how severe the injury).

									convience.

									Joystick give the users the feel of playing an old game.
